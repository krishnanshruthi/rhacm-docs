= Cluster import introduction

You can import clusters from different Kubernetes cloud providers. After you import, the target cluster becomes a managed cluster for the {mce-short} hub cluster. You can generally complete the import tasks anywhere that you can access the hub cluster and the target managed cluster, unless otherwise specified.

A hub cluster cannot manage _any_ other hub cluster, but can manage itself. The hub cluster is configured to automatically be imported and self-managed. You do not need to manually import the hub cluster. 

If you remove a hub cluster and try to import it again, you must add the `local-cluster:true` label to the `ManagedCluster` resource.

Read the following topics to learn more about importing a cluster so that you can manage it:
