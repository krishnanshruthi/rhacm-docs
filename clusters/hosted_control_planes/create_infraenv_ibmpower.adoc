= Creating an InfraEnv resource for hosted control planes on 64-bit x86 bare metal for IBM Power compute nodes

An `InfraEnv` is a environment where hosts that are starting the live ISO can join as agents. In this case, the agents are created in the same namespace as your hosted control plane.

To create an `InfraEnv` resource, complete the following steps:

. Create a YAML file to contain the configuration. See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  name: ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}
  namespace: ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  cpuArchitecture: ppc64le
  pullSecretRef:
    name: pull-secret
  sshAuthorizedKey: ${SSH_PUB_KEY}
----

. Save the file as `infraenv-config.yaml`.

. Apply the configuration by entering the following command:

+
----
oc apply -f infraenv-config.yaml
----

. To fetch the URL to download the live ISO, which allows IBM Power machines to join as agents, enter the following command:

+
----
oc -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> get InfraEnv <hosted_cluster_name> -o json
----
