[#dual-stack-finish-deployment]
= Finishing the hosted cluster deployment for a dual stack network

You can monitor the deployment of a hosted cluster from two perspectives: the control plane and the data plane.

[#dual-stack-monitor-hosted-cp]
== Monitoring the control plane

While the hosted cluster is deploying, you can enter the following commands to monitor the control plane:

----
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kcli/clusters/hub-ipv4/auth/kubeconfig
----

----
watch "oc get pod -n hypershift;echo;echo;oc get pod -n clusters-hosted-ipv4;echo;echo;oc get bmh -A;echo;echo;oc get agent -A;echo;echo;oc get infraenv -A;echo;echo;oc get hostedcluster -A;echo;echo;oc get nodepool -A;echo;echo;"
----

Those commands provide information about the following artifacts:

* The HyperShift Operator
* The `HostedControlPlane` pod
* The bare metal hosts
* The agents
* The `InfraEnv` resource
* The `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources

[#dual-stack-monitor-hosted-dp]
== Monitoring the data plane

To monitor how the Operators are progressing during the deployment process, enter the following commands:

----
oc get secret -n clusters-hosted-ipv4 admin-kubeconfig -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' |base64 -d > /root/hc_admin_kubeconfig.yaml
----

----
export KUBECONFIG=/root/hc_admin_kubeconfig.yaml
----

----
watch "oc get clusterversion,nodes,co"
----

Those commands provide information about the following artifacts:

* The cluster version
* The nodes, specifically, about whether the nodes joined the cluster
* The cluster Operators
