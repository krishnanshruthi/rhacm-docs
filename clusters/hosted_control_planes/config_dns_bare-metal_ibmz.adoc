= Configure DNS for hosted control plane

The API Server for the hosted cluster is exposed as a 'NodePort' service. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<base-domain>''` that points to the destination where the API Server can be reached.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane. 

The entry can also point to a load balancer that is deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the Ingress pods.

See the following example of DNS configuration:

[source,bash]
----
# cat /var/named/example.krnl.es.zone 
$TTL 900
@                     IN SOA bastion.example.krnl.es.com. hostmaster.example.krnl.es.com. (
                        2019062002 1D 1H 1W 3H
                      )
                      IN NS bastion.example.krnl.es.com.
api                   IN A 1xx.2x.2xx.1xx
api-int               IN A 1xx.2x.2xx.1xx
*.apps                IN A 1xx.2x.2xx.1xx
----

*Note:* In the previous example, `1xx.2x.2xx.1xx` is a load balancer IP address that handles ingress and egress traffic for hosted control plane.

For z/VM, add additional IP addresses that correspond to the IP address of the agent.

[source,bash]
----
worker-0              IN A 1xx.2x.2xx.1yy
worker-1              IN A 1xx.2x.2xx.1yy
