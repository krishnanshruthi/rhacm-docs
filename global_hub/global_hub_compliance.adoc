= Running the summarization process manually

You can also run the summarization process manually. This can be helpful when you are trying to investigate a problem or need a report sooner than the next scheduled routine. 

The manual summarization process consists of two subtasks:

* Insert the cluster policy data of that day from link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html[Materialized View]  `local_compliance_view_<yyyy_MM_dd>` to `history.local_compliance`.

* Update the `compliance` and policy flip `frequency` of that day to `history.local_compliance` based on `event.local_policies`.

Complete the following steps to run the summarization process manually: 

. Connect to the database.
+ 
You can use clients such as pgAdmin, tablePlush, and so on, to connect to the {global-hub} database to run the SQL statements in the next few steps. You can directly connect to the database on the cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc exec -it multicluster-global-hub-postgres-0 -n multicluster-global-hub -- psql -d hoh
----
       
. Determine the date when it needs to be run, such as `2023-07-06`.
+
If you find that there is no compliance information on the dashboard for `2023-07-06`, then find the job failure information of the day following this day in the `history.local_compliance_job_log`. In this case, it is `2023-07-07`. It can be determined that `2023-07-06` is the date when we need to manually run the summary processes.

. Check whether the Materialized View of `history.local_compliance_view_2023_07_06` exists by running the following command:
+
----
select * from history.local_compliance_view_2023_07_06;
----
+
If the view exists, load the view records to `history.local_compliance` by runnning the following command:
+
----
-- exec the insert func for that day '2023_07_06'
SELECT history.insert_local_compliance_job('2023_07_06');
----
+
If the view does not exist, inherit the history compliance records of the day before that day, in this example, it might be `2023_07_05`.
+
----
-- call the func to generate the data of '2023_07_06' by inheriting '2023_07_05'
CALL history.inherit_local_compliance_job('2023_07_05', '2023_07_06');
----

. Update the `compliance` and `frequency` information of that day to `history.local_compliance`.
+
----
-- call the func to update records start with '2023-07-06', end with '2023-07-07'
SELECT history.update_local_compliance_job('2023_07_06', '2023_07_07');
----

. Find the records of that day generated in `history.local_compliance`. You can safely delete the Materialized View `history.local_compliance_view_2023_07_06` by running the following command:
+
----
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS history.local_compliance_view_2023_07_06;
