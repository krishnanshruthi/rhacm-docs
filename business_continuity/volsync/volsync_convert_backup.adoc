= Converting a replicated image to a usable persistent volume claim

You might need to convert the replicated image to a persistent volume claim to recover data. 

When you replicate or restore a pesistent volume claim from a `ReplicationDestination` location by using a `VolumeSnapshot`, a `VolumeSnapshot` is created. The `VolumeSnapshot` contains the `latestImage` from the last successful synchronization. The copy of the image must be converted to a persistent volume claim before it can be used. The VolSync `ReplicationDestination` volume populator can be used to convert a copy of the image to a usable persistent volume claim.

. Create a persistent volume claim with a `dataSourceRef` that points to the `ReplicationDestination` where you want to restore a persistent volume claim. This persistent volume claim is populated with the contents of the `VolumeSnapshot` that is specified in the `status.latestImage` setting of the `ReplicationDestination` custom resource definition.
+
The following YAML content shows a sample persistent volume claim that might be used:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: <pvc-name>
  namespace: <destination-ns>
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  dataSourceRef:
    kind: ReplicationDestination
    apiGroup: volsync.backube
    name: <replicationdestination_to_replace>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
----
+
Replace `pvc-name` with a name for your new persistent volume claim.
+
Replace `destination-ns` with the namespace where the persistent volume claim and `ReplicationDestination` are located.
+
Replace `replicationdestination_to_replace` with the `ReplicationDestination` name.
+
**Best practice:** You can update `resources.requests.storage` with a different value when the value is at least the same size as the initial source persistent volume claim.

. Validate that your persistent volume claim is running in the environment by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kubectl get pvc -n <destination-ns>
----

*Note:*

If no `latestImage` exists, the persistent volume claim remains in a pending state until the `ReplicationDestination` completes and a snapshot is available.
You can create a `ReplicationDestination` and a persistent volume controller that use the `ReplicationDestination` at the same time. The persistent volume claim only starts
the volume population process after the `ReplicationDestination` completed a replication and a snapshot is available. You can find the snapshot in `.status.latestImage`.

Additionally, if the storage class that is used has a `volumeBindingMode` value of `WaitForFirstConsumer`, the volume populator waits until there is a
consumer of the persistent volume claim before it is populated. When a consumer requires access, such as a pod that wants to mount the persistent volume claim, then the volume
is populated. The VolSync volume populator controller uses the `latestImage` from the `ReplicationDestination`. The `latestImage` is updated each time a replication completes
after the persistent volume control was created.
